# Migrate WP Posts to Markdown

This is a simple script to migrate WordPress posts from siblanco.dev to markdown files.

It uses the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) to fetch the posts and [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to store the metadata.

Note that the REST API will be taken down as soon as the website rewrite in Astro is complete.
The rewrite to astro repo is [here](https://github.com/siblanco/siblanco-dev).
